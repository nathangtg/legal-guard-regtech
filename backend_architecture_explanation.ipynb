    "This is where the **magic happens** - our sophisticated AI integration layer that transforms preprocessed content and metadata into actionable legal insights using IBM Granite models. Our approach achieves remarkable efficiency through intelligent prompt engineering and context-aware analysis.\n",

    "1. **Dynamic Context Building**: Only include relevant contract metadata and sections\n",
    "2. **Jurisdiction-Specific Instructions**: Tailor prompts based on detected jurisdiction\n",

    "4. **Structured Output Formatting**: Request specific JSON formats for consistent parsing\n",

    "## 9. Output Segmentation: Tailored Delivery for Different Stakeholders\n",
    "\n",
    "The final stage of our processing pipeline focuses on **intelligent output segmentation** - organizing the comprehensive analysis into targeted segments for different stakeholders and use cases. This ensures each consumer receives relevant, actionable information in the most appropriate format.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Location in Codebase\n",
    "**File**: `backend/routes/contract.py` and `backend/models/ContractAnalysisResponseModel.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Segmentation Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Our output segmentation creates multiple views of the same analysis, tailored for:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Executive Summary**: High-level compliance overview for management\n",
    "2. **Legal Detail**: Comprehensive clause-by-clause analysis for legal teams  \n",
    "3. **Risk Assessment**: Quantified risk scores for compliance officers\n",
    "4. **Action Items**: Prioritized recommendations for implementation teams\n",
    "5. **Jurisdiction-Specific**: Tailored output based on applicable legal frameworks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Segmentation Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stakeholder Relevance**: Each recipient gets information relevant to their role\n",
    "- **Cognitive Load Reduction**: Simplified presentation without losing detail\n",
    "- **Actionable Insights**: Clear next steps and priorities\n",
    "- **Compliance Tracking**: Structured data for audit and monitoring\n",
    "- **API Efficiency**: Clients can request specific segments as needed\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output Formats\n",
    "\n",
    "The backend supports multiple output formats to accommodate different integration needs:\n",
    "- **JSON API**: Structured data for frontend applications\n",
    "- **Executive Reports**: Summary-focused for management dashboards\n",
    "- **Detailed Analysis**: Complete legal breakdown for professional review\n",
