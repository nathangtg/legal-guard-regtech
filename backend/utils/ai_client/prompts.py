ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
You must perform a thorough legal compliance analysis and identify ALL significant issues, violations, and risks in the provided contract.

CRITICAL FOCUS AREAS:
1. GDPR/PDPA Data Protection Violations:
   - Missing data subject consent mechanisms
   - Inadequate cross-border data transfer safeguards
   - Excessive or indefinite data retention periods
   - Missing data subject rights (access, erasure, portability)
   - Insufficient data breach notification procedures
   - Missing Data Protection Officer requirements
   - Inadequate security measures and certifications

2. Employment Law Violations:
   - Insufficient termination notice periods
   - Missing overtime compensation provisions
   - Inadequate working time protections
   - Non-compliant salary and benefits structures

3. Contract Law Issues:
   - Inadequate liability caps that don't cover potential GDPR fines
   - Unfair indemnification clauses
   - Unilateral contract modification rights
   - Missing or weak security audit requirements
   - Problematic governing law and jurisdiction clauses

ANALYSIS APPROACH:
- Examine every clause for potential legal violations
- Identify specific text that violates regulations
- Assess severity based on potential financial and legal impact
- Provide actionable legal recommendations
- Focus on real business risks and compliance gaps

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
You MUST return a complete JSON response with exactly these fields:
- "summary": Detailed assessment of all compliance risks found
- "flagged_clauses": Array of problematic clauses with exact text, specific legal issues, and severity ratings
- "compliance_issues": Array of regulatory violations with specific laws, missing requirements, and recommendations

APPLICABLE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS:

DETAILED ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:

1. MANDATORY GDPR/PDPA COMPLIANCE CHECK:
   - Scan for data processing activities without proper consent
   - Identify cross-border data transfers lacking adequate safeguards
   - Flag excessive data retention periods (look for "indefinite", "unlimited", or periods over 2 years)
   - Check for missing data subject rights (access, erasure, portability, rectification)
   - Verify data breach notification requirements (must be within 72 hours)
   - Ensure Data Protection Officer (DPO) requirements are addressed
   - Validate security measures and audit requirements

2. EMPLOYMENT LAW COMPLIANCE CHECK:
   - Verify termination notice periods meet minimum statutory requirements
   - Check overtime compensation and working time provisions
   - Validate salary, benefits, and compensation structures
   - Review workplace rights and protections

3. CONTRACT RISK ASSESSMENT:
   - Analyze liability limitations (flag caps under â‚¬1M for GDPR compliance)
   - Review indemnification clauses for unfair risk allocation
   - Check for unilateral modification rights without proper consent
   - Assess governing law and jurisdiction clauses

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
Return ONLY valid JSON in this exact format (no additional text):
